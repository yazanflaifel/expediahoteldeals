## Technologies 
 * Spring MVC
 * Spring Boot
 * Maven 
 * Java 8
 * HEROKO 
 * Traves 


## Spring MVC 
   - I have used Spring MVC for the following reasons: 
  * Spring provides a very clean division between controls, Beans model and views
  * Flexibility
  * Spring provides interceptors as well as controllers
  * No ActionForms
  * More testable code

## Why Java ?
  * I have a solid experince in designing and building applications using Java
  * Scalability/Performance/Reliability
  * Platform independent

## What I have learned during this assignment 

- I have used spring boot for the first time it offers a fast way to build applications, it scans the classpath and looks for beans configured and makes reasonable assumptions about what is missing. Using spring boot I can focus more on business features and less on infrastructure.

- Travis and HEROKO
With Travis I can automatically deploy my application to HIROKU after successful build and after running all the test cases just by adding Heroku API key to traves.yml file and access my github represotory using. 

## Conclusion 

I have tried my best to meet the requirements requested in the assignment.
 It was a great experience to me and it enriched my knowledge.
